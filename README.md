# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Project

This repository contains machine learning models to predict Bitcoin prices using LSTM, XGBoost, and Random Forest algorithms. The goal is to forecast price movements based on historical data and technical indicators.

## Key Features

- **Models Implemented:**
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
  - Random Forest

- **Technical Indicators:**
  - Moving Averages (MA)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  - Momentum

- **Tools Used:**
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
  - Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and model development

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git@github.com:YadidyaM/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. Adjust hyperparameters and explore different models to optimize predictions.
